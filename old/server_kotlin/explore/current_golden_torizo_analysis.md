# Golden Torizo Detection Analysis - Current Save File

## Memory Values
- bossPlus1: 0x0207
- bossPlus2: 0x0002
- bossPlus3: 0x0000
- bossPlus4: 0x0000

## Detection Conditions
- condition1: TRUE ((bossPlus1 & 0x0700) != 0 && (bossPlus1 & 0x0003) != 0)
- condition2: FALSE ((bossPlus2 & 0x0100) != 0 && bossPlus2 >= 0x0400)
- condition3: FALSE (bossPlus1 >= 0x0603)
- condition4: FALSE (bossPlus3 & 0x0100) != 0)

## Analysis
The issue is that condition1 is triggering a false positive:
- (0x0207 & 0x0700) = 0x0200, which is not 0
- (0x0207 & 0x0003) = 0x0003, which is not 0
- Therefore, condition1 is true, and Golden Torizo is detected as defeated

Please load a save file where Golden Torizo is actually defeated so we can compare values.
