# Super Metroid HUD Kotlin Server Test Coverage

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the test coverage for the Super Metroid HUD Kotlin server, focusing on the GameStateParser component. The tests ensure that the parser correctly interprets memory data from Super Metroid and converts it into a structured game state.

## Test Files

### 1. GameStateParserTest.kt

Basic tests for the GameStateParser class:
- `testParseBasicStats`: Tests parsing of health, missiles, etc.
- `testParseItemsNewGame`: Tests item parsing in a new game scenario
- `testParseItemsNormalGame`: Tests item parsing in normal gameplay
- `testParseBeamsNewGame`: Tests beam parsing in a new game scenario
- `testParseBeamsNormalGame`: Tests beam parsing in normal gameplay
- `testParseBosses`: Tests basic boss parsing
- `testParseLocationData`: Tests location data parsing
- `testMotherBrainCacheReset`: Tests resetting Mother Brain cache
- `testEmptyMemoryData`: Tests handling empty memory data
- `testIncompleteMemoryData`: Tests handling incomplete memory data

### 2. BossDetectionTest.kt

Specialized tests for boss detection logic:
- `testBasicBossDetection`: Tests detection of basic bosses (Bomb Torizo, Kraid, etc.)
- `testCrocomireDetection`: Tests Crocomire's special detection logic
- `testDraygonDetection`: Tests Draygon detection with the correct pattern
- `testPhantoonDetection`: Tests Phantoon detection
- `testBotwoonDetection`: Tests Botwoon detection with its two conditions
- `testSpeedBoosterDraygonConflict`: Tests the fix for the Speed Booster/Draygon conflict
- `testComplexScenario`: Tests a realistic game state with multiple bosses defeated

### 3. AdvancedGameStateParserTest.kt

Advanced tests for complex scenarios and edge cases:
- `testIntroSceneDetection`: Tests intro scene detection and item reset
- `testNormalGameplayItemParsing`: Tests item parsing in normal gameplay
- `testEdgeCaseBasicStatsParsing`: Tests edge cases for basic stats parsing
- `testComplexBossDetection`: Tests complex boss detection scenarios
- `testMotherBrainPhaseDetection`: Tests Mother Brain phase detection
- `testLocationDataParsing`: Tests various location data scenarios
- `testErrorHandling`: Tests error handling for various scenarios

### 4. MotherBrainPhaseDetectionTest.kt

Specialized tests for Mother Brain phase detection:
- `testMotherBrainBasicDetection`: Tests basic Mother Brain detection
- `testMotherBrainPhase1Detection`: Tests Mother Brain phase 1 detection
- `testMotherBrainPhase2Detection`: Tests Mother Brain phase 2 detection with escape timer
- `testMotherBrainPhasePersistence`: Tests persistence of Mother Brain phases
- `testMotherBrainCacheReset`: Tests resetting the Mother Brain cache
- `testMultipleEscapeTimers`: Tests detection with different escape timer addresses
- `testNuclearResetScenario`: Tests the "nuclear reset" scenario

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Mother Brain Phase Detection

The GameStateParser now properly implements Mother Brain phase detection:
- MB1 is detected when in the Mother Brain room with the Mother Brain bit set
- MB2 is detected when MB1 is detected and any escape timer is active
- Once detected, MB1 and MB2 persist even when leaving the room
- Implemented the "nuclear reset" scenario to reset MB2 when back in the MB room with reasonable missile count

### 2. Fixed Byte Conversion Issues

Fixed byte conversion errors in GameStateParserTest.kt:
- Added .toByte() to values outside the signed byte range (0x91 and 0x80)
- This ensures that the tests correctly handle the byte range limitations in Kotlin

### 3. Fixed Coroutine Issues

Fixed coroutine issues in BackgroundPollerTest.kt:
- Added the missing import for launch
- Used this.launch to reference the TestCoroutineScope
- This ensures that suspension functions are called within a coroutine body

## Test Coverage Analysis

The test suite now provides comprehensive coverage of the GameStateParser functionality:

1. **Basic Stats Parsing**: Covered by tests for normal gameplay, intro scene, and edge cases.
2. **Item and Beam Parsing**: Covered by tests for new game, normal gameplay, and reset logic.
3. **Boss Detection**: Extensively covered by tests for all bosses, including complex cases like Phantoon, Draygon, and Botwoon.
4. **Mother Brain Phase Detection**: Thoroughly tested with dedicated test files for various scenarios.
5. **Location Data Parsing**: Covered by tests for different areas and edge cases.
6. **Error Handling**: Covered by tests for empty data, null values, and invalid sizes.

## Conclusion

The test suite now provides robust coverage of the GameStateParser functionality, ensuring that it correctly parses memory data from Super Metroid and handles edge cases appropriately. The enhanced Mother Brain phase detection logic matches the Python implementation, providing consistent behavior across both servers.
