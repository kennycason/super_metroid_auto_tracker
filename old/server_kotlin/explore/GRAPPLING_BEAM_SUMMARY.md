# Grappling Beam Enabler Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented and tested a program that gives Samus the grappling beam in Super Metroid by writing to the game's memory through RetroArch's UDP interface.

## Implementation Details
- Created `GrapplingBeamEnabler.kt` - A standalone program that:
  - Connects to RetroArch via UDP
  - Reads the current items value from memory address 0x7E09A4
  - Sets the grappling beam bit (0x4000)
  - Writes the new value back to memory
  - Also sets the "equipped" bit at address 0x7E0003 (bit 6)

- Created two scripts:
  1. `run_grappling_beam_enabler.sh` - Original script (may have issues with port binding)
  2. `compile_and_run_grappling_beam.sh` - More reliable script using minimal Gradle configuration

## Testing Results
The program was successfully tested and produced the following output:
```
âœ… Successfully gave Samus the grappling beam!
ðŸŽ® You should now have the grappling beam in your inventory
...
âœ… Successfully equipped the grappling beam!
```

## How to Use
1. Make sure RetroArch is running with Super Metroid loaded
2. Run the script: `./explore/compile_and_run_grappling_beam.sh`
3. The program will connect to RetroArch, modify the memory, and give Samus the grappling beam

## Technical Challenges Overcome
- Port binding issues with the original build configuration
- Created a JVM-compatible version using standard Java networking libraries
- Developed a reliable build script with minimal dependencies

The implementation satisfies the original request to write a program that gives Samus the grappling beam by writing to the game's memory state.
