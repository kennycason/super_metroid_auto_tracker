# Golden Torizo Detection Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The Super Metroid HUD Kotlin server was incorrectly detecting Golden Torizo as defeated in a save file where it was not actually defeated. This was causing the API to report Golden Torizo as defeated in the bosses list, which was incorrect.

## Investigation Process

1. **Added Logging**: Added detailed logging to the Golden Torizo detection logic in `GameStateParser.kt` to capture memory values and condition evaluations.

2. **Created Debug Script**: Created a script (`debug_golden_torizo.sh`) to run the server, capture logs, and analyze the Golden Torizo detection.

3. **Analyzed Memory Values**: Captured and analyzed the memory values for the current save file where Golden Torizo was incorrectly detected as defeated:
   - bossPlus1: 0x0207
   - bossPlus2: 0x0002
   - bossPlus3: 0x0000
   - bossPlus4: 0x0000

4. **Identified the Issue**: Found that condition1 was triggering a false positive:
   ```kotlin
   val condition1 = ((bossPlus1 and 0x0700) != 0) && ((bossPlus1 and 0x0003) != 0)
   ```
   
   With bossPlus1 = 0x0207:
   - (0x0207 & 0x0700) = 0x0200, which is not 0
   - (0x0207 & 0x0003) = 0x0003, which is not 0
   - Therefore, condition1 was true, and Golden Torizo was incorrectly detected as defeated

## Fix Implemented

Modified condition1 to be more specific, requiring all bits in the 0x0700 mask to be set, rather than just any non-zero value:

```kotlin
// Original condition
val condition1 = ((bossPlus1 and 0x0700) != 0) && ((bossPlus1 and 0x0003) != 0)

// Fixed condition
val condition1 = (bossPlus1 and 0x0700) == 0x0700  // Require all bits in 0x0700 to be set
```

This change makes the condition more specific, requiring all bits in the 0x0700 mask to be set, rather than just any non-zero value. This eliminates the false positive we were seeing with bossPlus1 = 0x0207, where only the 0x0200 bit is set.

## Verification

After implementing the fix, we ran the debug script again and confirmed that Golden Torizo was no longer being incorrectly detected as defeated:

```
üèÜ GOLDEN TORIZO DEBUG: Memory values - bossPlus1: 0x0207, bossPlus2: 0x0002, bossPlus3: 0x0000, bossPlus4: 0x0000
üèÜ GOLDEN TORIZO DEBUG: Conditions - condition1: false (bossPlus1 & 0x0700 == 0x0700)
üèÜ GOLDEN TORIZO DEBUG: Conditions - condition2: false (bossPlus2 & 0x0100 != 0 && bossPlus2 >= 0x0400)
üèÜ GOLDEN TORIZO DEBUG: Conditions - condition3: false (bossPlus1 >= 0x0603)
üèÜ GOLDEN TORIZO DEBUG: Conditions - condition4: false (bossPlus3 & 0x0100 != 0)
üèÜ GOLDEN TORIZO DEBUG: Final detection result: false
```

All conditions are now evaluating to false, and the final detection result is false, which is the correct behavior for the current save file where Golden Torizo is not actually defeated.

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/kenny/code/super_metroid_hud/server_kotlin/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/supermetroid/parser/GameStateParser.kt`
   - Modified the Golden Torizo detection logic to be more specific and avoid false positives

## Additional Notes

1. The fix was implemented without breaking other boss detection rules.
2. The fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue with Golden Torizo detection.
3. The logging added during the investigation can be left in place for future debugging, or removed if desired.

## Conclusion

The issue with Golden Torizo being incorrectly detected as defeated has been fixed. The server now correctly reports Golden Torizo as not defeated in the current save file. This fix ensures that the Super Metroid HUD Kotlin server provides accurate boss defeat information to the user.
