# Super Metroid HUD Tests

This directory contains comprehensive unit tests for the Super Metroid HUD tracker.

## Test Coverage

### `test_basic_functionality.py` ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
Pragmatic tests for current working functionality (100% pass rate):

- **Parser Structure**: Validates all parsing methods return expected data structures
- **Basic Stats**: Health, missiles, power bombs parsing validation
- **Items & Beams**: Equipment and beam detection structure validation
- **Boss Detection**: Structure validation for all boss detection logic
- **Mother Brain Logic**: Tests the key intermediate state fix we implemented
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with invalid data
- **Integration**: End-to-end parsing validation

### `test_game_state_parser.py` üìã **COMPREHENSIVE**
Detailed tests with specific expected values (may have failures):

- **Exact Value Testing**: Tests specific memory patterns and expected results
- **False Positive Prevention**: Rigorous testing of Ridley/Golden Torizo fixes
- **Edge Case Scenarios**: Complex test cases for various game states
- **Threshold Testing**: Validates detection thresholds and boundaries
- **Advanced Scenarios**: Mother Brain phases, save state edge cases

**Note**: This test suite may have failures due to exact value expectations vs current implementation. Use for development and debugging.

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
# From project root
python -m test.test_game_state_parser

# Or directly
cd test/
python test_game_state_parser.py
```

### Run with Verbose Output
```bash
python test_game_state_parser.py
```

## Test Data

Tests use real memory patterns from confirmed working game sessions:
- `0x3105` - Items data with known equipment
- `0x1006` - Beams data with known configuration
- `0x0304` - Boss data with confirmed defeats
- `0x0203` - Patterns that previously caused false positives

## Key Test Cases

### False Positive Prevention
- **Ridley**: Ensures `0x0203` pattern doesn't trigger false positive
- **Golden Torizo**: Ensures patterns below `0x0603` don't trigger
- **Mother Brain**: Ensures intermediate fight states are handled correctly

### Mother Brain Special Cases
- **MB1 Detection**: During MB2 fight, MB1 should show as defeated
- **MB2 Detection**: Should be false during fight, true only when complete
- **Complete Sequence**: All phases true when main Mother Brain bit is set

### Edge Cases
- Empty/null data handling
- Malformed memory data
- Invalid game states
- Integration testing

## Adding New Tests

1. Add test methods to `TestGameStateParser` class
2. Use real memory patterns when possible
3. Test both positive and negative cases
4. Include descriptive assertions and print statements
5. Follow naming convention: `test_feature_description`

## Test Philosophy

- **Use Real Data**: Tests use actual memory patterns from game sessions
- **Test Fixes**: Every bug fix has corresponding test cases
- **Prevent Regressions**: False positive fixes are thoroughly tested
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All parsing logic is tested
- **Clear Output**: Tests provide detailed feedback for debugging
