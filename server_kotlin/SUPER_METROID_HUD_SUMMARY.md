# Super Metroid HUD Kotlin Server - Project Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work done on the Super Metroid HUD Kotlin server, including issues identified, fixes implemented, current state, and recommendations for future work.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Code Compilation Issues
- Fixed byte conversion errors in GameStateParserTest.kt by adding `.toByte()` for values outside the signed byte range
- Fixed coroutine issues in BackgroundPollerTest.kt by adding proper imports and using the correct scope
- Added `@Suppress` annotations for unused parameters and variables

### 2. Server Startup Issues
- Updated executable path in manage_server.sh from server.kexe to server_kotlin.kexe
- Improved port conflict handling in manage_server.sh
- Created port_check.sh script to diagnose and fix port conflicts

### 3. UDP Communication Issues
- Rewrote RetroArchUDPClient.kt to match the Python implementation
- Created a new socket for each command instead of reusing sockets
- Set proper timeouts on sockets
- Simplified error handling
- Removed clearing of pending data
- Closed sockets after each command
- Switched from MockRetroArchUDPClient to real RetroArchUDPClient in BackgroundPoller.kt

### 4. Boss Detection Issues
- Fixed Ridley detection by implementing complex detection logic using boss_plus_2 and boss_plus_4 patterns
- Fixed Golden Torizo detection by making condition1 more specific to avoid false positives
- Fixed Crocomire detection by reading from the correct memory address (0x7ED829 instead of 0x7ED82C)
- Added comprehensive test cases for boss detection

### 5. Reserve Energy Display Issues
- Fixed incorrect offset in parseBasicStats method for max_reserve_energy (changed from 16 to 18)
- Enabled encodeDefaults in JSON serialization to include properties with default values

### 6. Samus Ship Detection
- Implemented proper end game detection logic based on the Python implementation
- Added necessary memory addresses to the memory map (ship_ai and event_flags)
- Modified BackgroundPoller.kt to read these memory addresses
- Implemented detectSamusShip method with multiple detection approaches

## Current State

The server now:
- Builds successfully without errors
- Starts and stops correctly
- Communicates with RetroArch via UDP
- Correctly detects all bosses, including Ridley, Golden Torizo, and Crocomire
- Correctly displays reserve energy
- Has proper end game detection logic

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Mother Brain Phase Detection Bootstrap
- The bootstrapMbCacheIfNeeded method in BackgroundPoller.kt has a comment suggesting it should call parser.setMotherBrainComplete(), but this method doesn't exist
- The Python implementation has a bootstrap_mb_cache method in the SuperMetroidGameStateParser class that's used to bootstrap the Mother Brain cache based on the current game state
- The Kotlin implementation should have a similar method that sets the Mother Brain phase state based on the current game state

### 2. Port Configuration
- The server sometimes starts on different ports (8081, 8082, 8083) which can cause confusion
- The manage_server.sh script should be updated to consistently use the same port

### 3. Token Limit Issues
- The AI sometimes hits token limits when generating responses, causing incomplete or truncated responses
- Responses should be broken down into smaller chunks to avoid token limits

## Recommendations for Future Work

### 1. Implement Mother Brain Phase Detection Bootstrap
- Add a setMotherBrainComplete method to GameStateParser.kt that sets the Mother Brain phase state based on the current game state
- Update bootstrapMbCacheIfNeeded in BackgroundPoller.kt to call this method
- Add tests for this functionality

### 2. Standardize Port Configuration
- Update manage_server.sh to always use the same port (e.g., 8081)
- Add a comment to the KOTLIN_PORT variable indicating that it should not be changed
- Update documentation to reflect the standard port

### 3. Improve Error Handling
- Add more robust error handling for UDP communication
- Add more detailed logging for debugging purposes
- Add more comprehensive tests for error scenarios

### 4. Enhance Documentation
- Create a comprehensive README.md file explaining how to build, run, and test the server
- Document the memory map and how it relates to Super Metroid's memory layout
- Document the boss detection logic and how it works

### 5. Optimize Performance
- Profile the server to identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize UDP communication to reduce latency
- Consider batching memory reads to reduce the number of UDP packets

## Conclusion

The Super Metroid HUD Kotlin server has been significantly improved, with most issues fixed and the server now functioning correctly. The remaining issues are relatively minor and can be addressed in future work. The server now provides accurate game state information to the HUD, including boss detection, item collection, and end game detection.
