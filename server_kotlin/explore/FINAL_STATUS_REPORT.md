# Super Metroid HUD Kotlin Server - Final Status Report

## Accomplishments

We've successfully addressed numerous issues in the Super Metroid HUD Kotlin server:

1. Fixed code compilation issues (byte conversion, coroutine issues)
2. Resolved server startup problems (executable path, port conflicts)
3. Fixed UDP communication with RetroArch
4. Corrected boss detection for Ridley, Golden Torizo, and Crocomire
5. Fixed reserve energy display
6. Implemented proper Samus ship detection

## Documentation Created

1. **SUPER_METROID_HUD_SUMMARY.md**: Comprehensive overview of all fixes, current state, and remaining issues
2. **explore/MOTHER_BRAIN_BOOTSTRAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Detailed implementation guide for the Mother Brain phase detection bootstrap functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Mother Brain Bootstrap**: Follow the implementation guide to add proper Mother Brain phase detection when loading save files
2. **Standardize Port Configuration**: Update manage_server.sh to consistently use port 8081
3. **Enhance Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for UDP communication
4. **Improve Documentation**: Create a comprehensive README.md file

## How to Use These Files

- Use **SUPER_METROID_HUD_SUMMARY.md** as a reference for understanding the project's current state and remaining issues
- Follow **MOTHER_BRAIN_BOOTSTRAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md** for implementing the Mother Brain bootstrap functionality
- Send these files to new AI prompts to continue work on the project without having to re-explain the entire codebase
